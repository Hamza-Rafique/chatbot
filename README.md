## Introduction

This chatbot is designed to simulate human-like conversations using AI. It's built with Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and can be integrated with web applications. The chatbot can handle various user queries by utilizing machine learning models, making it ideal for customer service, personal assistants, and interactive AI applications.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Responses**: Provides intelligent and context-aware replies.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Leverages trained models to understand and generate human-like responses.
- **Customizable Intents**: You can modify or add new intents and responses as per your requirements.
- **Flexible Integration**: API-based structure that can be integrated into various applications (ReactJS, web apps, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Data**: JSON format for intents and responses
- **Machine Learning**: LSTM model for chatbot training
